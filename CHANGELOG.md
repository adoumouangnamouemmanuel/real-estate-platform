# Changelog

All notable changes to this repository will be documented in this file.

The format follows Keep a Changelog and the project uses a roadmap-driven delivery model.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Frontend: testing infrastructure.** Vitest + React Testing Library for unit
  and integration tests, Playwright + axe-core for E2E and automated
  accessibility scanning (see ADR-008 in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`). 67 unit/
  integration tests, 70 E2E tests across 5 browser/viewport projects. CI now
  runs typecheck, lint, format check, tests with coverage, build, and a
  Chromium E2E pass on every PR.
- **Frontend: Developer domain.** Developer listing (`/developers`) with search,
  city filter, sorting, pagination, and card/loading/empty/error states; developer
  profile pages (`/developers/[slug]`) with cover image, logo, bio, contact info,
  social links, stats, active listings, featured properties, and a map placeholder
  behind `FEATURES.MAP_VIEW`. Property detail pages link into developer profiles
  (`components/property/DeveloperInfoCard` → `/developers/[slug]`), completing the
  Property ↔ Developer navigation loop.
- **Frontend: Properties domain.** Property listing (`/properties`), detail pages
  (`/properties/[slug]`), and search/filtering (`/search`) — grid, gallery,
  amenities, location, developer contact card, WhatsApp CTA (behind
  `FEATURES.WHATSAPP_CONTACT`), related properties, and URL-driven filters
  (category, city, price range, sort, keyword).
- **Frontend: architecture foundation.** App Router shell, design tokens, shared
  services/React Query data layer, auth session bootstrap + route protection,
  and the shared error/loading/empty-state pattern used across both domains.
- Initial repository documentation scaffold.
- GitHub governance files, issue templates, and workflow placeholders.

### Fixed

- `PropertyMediaGallery`'s thumbnail picker used `role="tablist"`/`role="tab"`
  without the arrow-key navigation that ARIA tab semantics require — found
  during the Phase 4 accessibility audit (not by automated axe scanning, which
  checks markup validity, not keyboard interaction contracts). Replaced with
  `role="group"` + `aria-current`, matching `Pagination`'s existing pattern.
- `ErrorBoundary` was fully built in Phase 1 but never mounted anywhere — wired
  into the root layout so a render-time error anywhere in the app shows a
  graceful fallback instead of a blank screen.

### Changed

- Extracted `useFilterNavigation`: `PropertiesView` and `DevelopersView` each
  had identical URL-building logic; both now share one hook.

## [2026-06-16] - Initial Scaffold

### Added

- Root documentation for the ByTe Real Estate Platform repository.
- Contribution rules aligned with the monorepo roadmap.
